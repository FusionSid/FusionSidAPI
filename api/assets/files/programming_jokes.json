Attempting to delet this otion would immediately cause your cars performance to diminish by 50% or more.\n13) every time GM introduced a new car, people would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the old controls would function in the new car.\n14) Macintosh would make a car that was five times faster, ten times more reliable and easier to mantain, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five percent of the roads.\"",

    "This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be Year 2000 compliant. This program is known as \"Millennia Year Application Software System\" (MYASS). \nNext Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. \n\nSome employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, \"I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before.\" I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS. \n\nThere have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. This database will encompass all information associated with the business. \n\nAs you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, \"here, stick this in MYASS.\" It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond, \"Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS.\"",

If the toilet is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty seconds later, the roll of toilet paper will retract into the dispenser, the toilet will flush and the door will open automatically. If the toilet remains occupied, your photograph will be taken by a security camera and will appear on the Toilet Offenders Board.

    "In March 1992 a man living in Newton near Boston Massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it away. In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash. The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt. The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.",
    "A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains: \"I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa.\" Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, \"Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $50\" figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, she agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question: \"What's the distance from the earth to the moon?\" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a five-dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: \"What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?\" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the digital cellphone via infra-red wireless connection to his modem port and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mail to all his co-workers, friends, clients, and suppliers that he knows. And then some. All to no avail. After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $50. The blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, \"Well, so what IS the answer?\" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.",

    "Dear Sir,\n\nI've been having some conflicts between programs lately. I've been running\nthe original version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 as my primary application and\nall the GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.\nI hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background\nmode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find\nthe switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately and it works\nokay. GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf\nprogram, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility.\n\nI probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might\nsee better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and\nother problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend\n2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0,\nand eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right\n- as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself. Shortly after that,\nI installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone\nbut the first time I used it, it gave me a virus. I had to clean out my\nwhole system and shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend\n4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection\nprogram. It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend\n1.0 was still in my system. I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend\n4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about\nthat automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend\nand communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal\nof both versions. The version I have now works pretty well, but there are\nstill some problems.\n\nLike all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language\nI can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly, I think there is too\nmuch attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality.\nAlso, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have\nto use gold-plated contacts. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally\nobject-oriented.\n\nA year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus\n1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered\nthat GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't upgrade to Fianc\u00e9\n1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which\nhe describes as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space so he\ncan't load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with\nWife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out\nthat the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access\nto FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. On top\nof that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he\ncan do anything.\n\nAlthough he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 also came with MotherInLaw\n1.0 which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off. I told him\nto try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he'd heard that if you try\nto run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney\nfiles before doing the uninstall itself. Then, Mistress 1.0 won't install\nanyway because of insufficient resources.",

The Lord knew the specs weren't sufficient\nbut followed them anyway. He also made some programmers that did just what\nprogrammers were supposed to do, just to spite IBM. The programmers and\nIBM spent the rest of the day creating the Assembler and FORTRAN. On the\nmorning of the fifth day, IBM reported to the Lord once again.\n\n\"The programmers you created for me have a problem. They want a programming\nlanguage that is easy to use and similar to English. I told them you had\ncursed English, though I still don't know why. They wanted me to ask your\nindulgence on this.\"\n\nThe Lord had cursed English for good reason, but didn't want to explain\nthis to IBM. He said \"let there be COBOL\" and that was that.\n\nOn the status report of the next day IBM announced that computers had\ngone forth and multiplied. Unfortunately, the computers still weren't big\nenough or fast enough to do what the programmers wanted. The Lord liked\nthe idea of going forth multiplying, and used the line Himself later on\nthat day. This sixth day being particularly busy, He declared \"Let there\nbe MVS\" and there was MVS.\n\nOn the seventh day God had finished creation and computers had COBOL\nand MVS. The Lord and IBM took the day off to go fishing. IBM hung a sign\non the door to help programmers in his absence.\n\n\nOn the start of the second week the programmers went over IBM's cathode\nray tube directly to God. \"We have a horrible problem,\" they complained.\n\"Our users want systems that perform according to their expectations.\"\n\n\"USERS!\" the Lord bellowed. \"Who said that you should have users! Users\nare the difference between good and bad applications, a function I have\nreserved unto myself! Who authorized you to have users?\"\n\n\"Well, IBM...\"\n\n\"IBM!! You!! You did this to my programmers! You gave them the knowledge\nof good and evil. For that you shall suffer through eternity! Let there\nbe competition. Let it be called Anacom, and Burroughs, and CDC.\" The Lord\nwent through the alphabet several times. \"With all this competition you\nshall still suffer the pain of antitrust legislation all the days of your\nexistence.\"\n\nThis was the start of the second week, and it seems an appropriate place\nto conclude our report. In case you missed something, a summary of key\npoints follows.",

    "Like every other techie, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the just released, state-of-the-art, 64-bit, 128 mega-RAM, 48x, 24/7, in your face, out of your control Microself Windows 2001. Yes, that was me at the front of the line in our local Get-a-Life Software store, waiting, waiting, for the moment when the future went on sale. And now that the future is installed in my computer, there's no looking back.\n\nTo be truthful, I don't use computers. They use me. They use me as a portal between the glittering new world of information and the mundane world where ordinary people have to eat and talk and sometimes be sad. Computers use my nimble fingers to unlock their codes, releasing raw information into the ether. Taking my mission as seriously as I do, I wanted the most up-to-the-second tool on the market. And that's why, the day after I installed Windows 2001, I was back at Get-a-Life buying the upgrade, Windows 2001, version 2.0.\n\nWith Windows 2001 2.0, I don't process information. I download it into my body. Using Windows' revolutionary US-ME serial port installed in my navel, I plug myself into my computer. Like the umbilical cord that fed me when I was mere flesh, the US-ME cable feeds raw data straight into my bloodstream. There it flows until it reaches the central processing unit I used to call my brain. And there, Windows' revolutionary Brain Bot - a tiny microchip embedded in my cerebrum -- turns that raw data into wisdom that makes me smarter, richer, and so much wiser than the rest of you.\n\nDid you know that the capital of Uganda is Kampala? That Soupy Sales had a lion puppet named Pookie? That the square root of 3 is 1.732? And that today's kids will spend 23 years of their lives on the Internet swimming through vital data like this? O, it's a changing world, my friend. When you leave your Silicon Valley job for two weeks of R & R, take a cruise to Antarctica, step onto an ice floe and see penguins crowded around a laptop checking out The Weather Channel, get worried!\n\nBut I'm not worried, I'm wired. Wired to the upgraded upgrade I bought last weekend. Windows 2001 3.0 is the one with HandPrint, the printer driver that drives my digital age. Using HandPrint, I don't need an ordinary printer. I just click a button on my wrist and my hand begins scrolling across a blank page printing my raw data in any of 1,257 perfect fonts. The moving hand writes, and having writ, gives way to ear-mail.\n\nI know, I know. You all have e-mail accounts. You can e-mail Bill Gates if you want. The Pope. Your dog if you're on vacation in Antarctica. But only Windows 2001 4.0, which I bought yesterday, has ear-mail.\n\nWhen I hear a voice from the ether saying \"You've got mail!\" I run to the nearest phone. Then I run my ear-mail cord from the phone to an input implanted below my left ear. Within seconds, I'm hearing the mail read by a soothing voice that sounds a little like James Earl Jones on Prozac. To reply, I simply speak my answer, press the same button on my wrist, and presto. I unplug and go back to my daily duty of becoming richer,\nsmarter, and wiser. There's also a wireless version of e-mail but that won't come out until version 5.0 is released tomorrow. I plan to get in line at Get-a-Life sometime before midnight.\n\nBut where, you ask, is this wireless world headed? To be truthful, I'm not sure, but it sure is fun. Perhaps when I'm even richer, smarter, and wiser than I am now, thanks to\nWindows 2001 6.0 due out this weekend, I'll have an answer. Until then, you'll have to excuse me. I have mail.",
    "An old, bearded shepherd, with a crooked staff, walks up to a stone pulpit and says:\n\n\"And lo it came to pass that the trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\n\nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, Dear?\" And Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)\".\n\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.\n\nThey were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. And lo the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would only work if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.\n\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others\". And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known, \"eBay,\" he said, \"we need a name of a service that reflects what we are,\" and Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\" \"Whoopee!\", said Abraham. \"No, YAHOO!\", said Dot Com.",
